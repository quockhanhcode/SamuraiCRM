Description:
    The 'rails modular_engine new' command creates a skeleton for developing an extendable modular engine.

Example:
    rails modular_engine new ~/Code/Ruby/my_app/engines/blog 'Namespace1/Namespace2'

    This generates a skeletal Rails engine in ~/Code/Ruby/my_app/engines/blog.
    See the README in the newly created engine to get going.
